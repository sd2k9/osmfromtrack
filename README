osmfromtrack
============

Download OSM data around a GPX track


Description
===========
You can feed the tool with a track in GPX format.
It then fetches all the OSM data around a certain distance
of the track.

My intended usage is to feed the greated OSM files to mkgmap,
which I can then download to my Garmin eTrex30 to have the map
material for my next trip available.


State
=====
Initially created, Ongoing development, not usable yet


Brainstorming
=============
Manual data fetching with OSM (X)API:
- Example export from www.openstreetmap.org
       47.1916
9.8237		9.8746
	47.1423

API - Data identical
curl --location --globoff -o map-osm-api.osm  'http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=9.8237,47.1423,9.8746,47.1916'

XAPI - Seems to be reordered compared to API result, but content-wise identical
curl --location --globoff -o map-osm-xapi.osm  'http://open.mapquestapi.com/xapi/api/0.6/map?bbox=9.8237,47.1423,9.8746,47.1916'

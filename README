osmfromtrack - Later Goal
============

Download OSM data around a GPX track

Description - Later Goal
===========

You can feed the tool with a track in GPX format.
It then fetches all the OSM data around a certain distance
of the track.

My intended usage is to feed the greated OSM files to mkgmap,
which I can then download to my Garmin eTrex30 to have the map
material for my next trip available.

You can get etrex30 from
https://github.com/sd2k9/tools/blob/master/etrex30

Topographic Map Configuration for Debian
========================================
See also
    http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Topographic_maps_for_garmin_devices

To create a topographic map you need the tool phyghtmap.
If you don't want this, just use the command line option "--no-topo"

For the current version  1.43-1 you also need to apply the following patch
to being able to set the hgt cache directory:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Edamame/PatchPhyghtmapHgtDir
If not wanted, just remove the line
"opts['topo_opts_hgtcache'].format(dir=opts['topo_hgtcache_dir']),"
from the execute_cmd code

Another patch (currently unreleased) is required to invoke etrex30 from within.
For now, remove the following line
                       "--verbatim-output-name" ],    # phyghtmap improvement not to mangle the file name
(and replace by a single "]," )


How to setup phyghtmap with debian (other OS may vary)
- Get DEB packet of phyghtmap from http://katze.tfiu.de/projects/phyghtmap/
  e.g. http://katze.tfiu.de/projects/phyghtmap/phyghtmap_1.43-1_all.deb
- Install, e.g.
  sudo dpkg -i  phyghtmap_1.43-1_all.deb
- For Version 1.43 you manually need to repair some things
- If you get the error
  File "/usr/bin/phyghtmap", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  ImportError: No module named pkg_resources
  ---> Solution: sudo aptitude install python-pkg-resources
- If you get the error
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 584, in resolve
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)
    pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: phyghtmap==1.43
  ---> Solution:
       cd ../../python2.7/dist-packages/
       sudo ln -s ../../python2.6/dist-packages/phyghtmap
       sudo ln -s ../../python2.6/dist-packages/phyghtmap-1.43.egg-info/

A sample call as done by osmfromtrack:
  phyghtmap --area=9.755300:47.478000:9.804400:47.502600 --step=50 -o srtmtest \
  --line-cat=400,100 --jobs=2  --viewfinder-mask=1

Configuration can be done at the top of osmfromtrack file, look for 'topo_opts'

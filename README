osmfromtrack
============

Download OSM data from within a coordinate box

State
=====
Initially created, Ongoing development, not usable yet

Description
===========

You can feed the tool with two set of coorinates (like from Google Map's LatLng marker)
and the box will be fetched from OSM.


osmfromtrack - Later Goal
============

Download OSM data around a GPX track

Description - Later Goal
===========

You can feed the tool with a track in GPX format.
It then fetches all the OSM data around a certain distance
of the track.

My intended usage is to feed the greated OSM files to mkgmap,
which I can then download to my Garmin eTrex30 to have the map
material for my next trip available.



Brainstorming
=============
Manual data fetching with OSM (X)API:
- Example export from www.openstreetmap.org
       47.1916
9.8237		9.8746
	47.1423

- bbox = left,down,right,up

API - Data identical
curl --location --globoff -o map-osm-api.osm  'http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=9.8237,47.1423,9.8746,47.1916'

XAPI - Seems to be reordered compared to API result, but content-wise identical
curl --location --globoff -o map-osm-xapi.osm  'http://open.mapquestapi.com/xapi/api/0.6/map?bbox=9.8237,47.1423,9.8746,47.1916'
